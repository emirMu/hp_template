		<p>This is the first line of the article. I am writing an article to try to find out how to type a blog post using my own designs which I have just created using Sublime Text and nothing else.</p>

		<p>This is the second paragraph of the article. This was written after the first paragraph was saved</p>

		<p>This is the third paragraph of the article. I don't know why I need more than two paragraphs but might as well write it.</p>

		<h3>#tag1, #tag3, #firstpost, #html, #css3</h3>
